## Hello and welcome to this blog. 
I hope you find this record of my deep learning course experience useful in some way.

I am a retired electrical engineer who enjoys learning new skills, especially programming skills.

I am currently working my way through the Deep Learning course on fast.ai.
The course requires creation and training of various artificial neural networks and this, of course,
requires access to a modern GPU (graphics processing unit).
I considered purchasing a used GPU to add to my ancient, but wonderful, IBM Thinkstation.
But, I soon discovered that I could spend $8 a month to have access on Paperspace Gradient to a machine
with 8 VCPUs and an Nvidia RTS5000 GPU. The cost of a used Nvidia RTX2060 would cover 34 months of my
Gradient access. So, going with gradient was a no-brainer!

In a quick test, I discovered that training the NN from the first lesson on fast.ai took my Thinkstation
over four hours. I was able to accomplish the same training on my Gradient machine in 6 minutes.

This blog is divided into sections listed as "posts" below.

Enjoy.
